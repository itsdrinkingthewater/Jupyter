Microsoft Sentinel Notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are an interactive development and data analysis environment hosted in a browser. The open API supported by Microsoft Sentinel allows you to use Jupyter notebooks to query, transform, analyze and visualize Microsoft Sentinel data. This makes notebooks a powerful addition to Microsoft Sentinel and is especially well-suited to ad-hoc investigations, hunting or customized workflows.
